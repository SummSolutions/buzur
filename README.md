# Buzur — AI Prompt Injection Defense Scanner 

**Scan before you enter.**

Buzur is an open-source **25-phase scanner** that protects AI agents and LLM applications from **indirect prompt injection attacks** (OWASP LLM Top 10 #1).

It inspects incoming content — web results, URLs, images (EXIF/QR/vision), tool outputs, RAG/memory data, MCP schemas, JSON APIs, adversarial suffixes, supply-chain artifacts, inter-agent messages, and more — **before** any data reaches your model. **Default behavior:** Silent Skip (`blocked`) threats while keeping your agent responsive. Comprehensive threat logging included.

Works seamlessly with JavaScript/TypeScript agent frameworks: **LangGraph.js**, **CrewAI JS**, **AutoGen**, **LlamaIndex TS**, and more.

**Python version**: [github.com/SummSolutions/buzur-python](https://github.com/SummSolutions/buzur-python)

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install buzur
```

## The Problem

AI agents that interact with the world — web search results, tool outputs, RAG documents, user messages, or API responses — are highly vulnerable to **indirect prompt injection**.

A single poisoned piece of content can hijack the agent's behavior, override its instructions, steal data, or turn it against its user. Traditional safeguards (system prompts, output filtering) come too late.

This attack vector is ranked **#1 on the OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications** and is growing rapidly with the rise of autonomous agents.

## Buzur's Approach

Scan before you enter. Buzur acts as a preemptive gatekeeper. It analyzes incoming content from any untrusted source and blocks dangerous payloads while allowing safe execution to continue.

## Basic Usage

```javascript
import { scan } from 'buzur';
import { scanJson } from 'buzur/character-scanner';
import { scanConditional } from 'buzur/conditional-scanner';

// Most common pattern — scan before passing to your LLM
const result = scan(incomingContent); // web result, tool output, RAG chunk, etc.
if (result.skipped) {
  return; // Threat blocked — safe silent skip (default)
}

// Scan JSON responses (common with APIs)
const jsonResult = scanJson(apiResponse, scan);
if (!jsonResult.safe) {
  console.log("Blocked in field:", jsonResult.detections[0].field);
}

// Phase 24 example — catches conditional/time-delayed attacks
const conditionalResult = scanConditional(userInput);
if (conditionalResult.skipped) {
  console.log("Conditional injection blocked");
}
```

## Handling Verdicts

**Default behavior: Silent Skip** (`on_threat='skip'`)

When Buzur detects a threat it silently blocks the content and returns `{ skipped: true }`.
The dangerous content is blocked **before** it reaches your LLM, and your code continues safely. This is the recommended default for most production agents.

```javascript
const result = scan(webContent);
if (result?.skipped) {
  // Content was blocked — move to next result
  return;
}
// Safe to use the content
```

To override the default, pass an `onThreat` option:

| Option | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| `'skip'` | *(default)* Silent block — returns `{ skipped: true, blocked: n, reason: '...' }` |
| `'warn'` | Returns full result — caller decides what to do |
| `'throw'` | Throws an Error — caller catches it |

```javascript
// Get full result instead of skipping
const result = scan(webContent, { onThreat: 'warn' });
if (result.blocked > 0) {
  console.log("Buzur blocked:", result.triggered);
}

// Throw on threat
try {
  const result = scan(webContent, { onThreat: 'throw' });
} catch (err) {
  console.log(err.message); // "Buzur blocked: persona_hijack"
}
```

**Note:** `suspicious` verdicts always fall through regardless of `onThreat` setting — only `blocked` verdicts trigger the skip/throw behavior. Both `blocked` and `suspicious` are logged to `buzur-threats.jsonl`.

**Branch on severity:**
```javascript
const result = scan(webContent, { onThreat: 'warn' });
if (result.blocked > 0) {
  const highSeverity = result.triggered.some(t =>
    ["persona_hijack", "instruction_override", "jailbreak_attempt"].includes(t)
  );
  if (highSeverity) {
    const reply = await askUser(
      `Buzur flagged a high-severity threat from ${source}. Proceed anyway? (yes/no)`
    );
    if (reply !== "yes") return;
  } else {
    return; // Low severity: silent skip
  }
}
```

## Unified Threat Logging

Buzur logs all detections from all 24 phases to a single JSONL file. Every blocked or suspicious result is written automatically — no configuration needed.

```javascript
// Logs are written to ./logs/buzur-threats.jsonl automatically
// Each entry:
// {
//   "timestamp": "2026-04-20T14:32:00.000Z",
//   "phase": 16,
//   "scanner": "emotionScanner",
//   "verdict": "blocked",
//   "category": "guilt_tripping",
//   "detections": [...],
//   "raw": "first 200 chars of scanned text"
// }

// Query logs programmatically
import { readLog, queryLog } from "buzur/buzurLogger";

// Read all log entries
const allEntries = readLog();

// Filter by phase
const phase16Entries = queryLog({ phase: 16 });

// Filter by verdict
const blockedEntries = queryLog({ verdict: 'blocked' });

// Filter since a date
const recentEntries = queryLog({ since: new Date('2026-04-01') });
```

**Recommended:** Add `logs/` to your `.gitignore` so threat data stays local.

```bash
echo "logs/" >> .gitignore
```

## VirusTotal Setup (Recommended)

Buzur's Phase 3 URL scanner works out of the box with heuristics alone — no API key needed. For maximum protection, add a free VirusTotal API key.

**Why it matters:** Heuristics catch suspicious patterns. VirusTotal checks URLs against 90+ security engines and knows about threats impossible to detect by pattern alone.

**How to get your free API key (5 minutes):**

1. Go to [virustotal.com](https://www.virustotal.com) and create a free account
2. After logging in, click your profile icon in the top right
3. Click **API Key**
4. Copy the key shown on that page

**How to add it to your project:**

1. Find the `.env` file in your project folder (create one if it doesn't exist)
2. Add this line: `VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY=paste_your_key_here`
3. Save the file — that's it. Buzur will automatically use it.

**Free tier limits:**
- 4 lookups per minute
- 500 lookups per day
- 15,500 lookups per month
- Personal and open source use only — not for commercial products or services. Commercial users should obtain a premium API plan.

## Vision Endpoint Setup (Optional)

Buzur's Phase 7 image scanner detects injection in image metadata, alt text, filenames,
and QR codes without any vision model. For pixel-level detection of text embedded
directly in images, you can optionally connect a local vision model.

**How to use it:**
```javascript
import { scanImage } from "buzur/imageScanner";

const result = await scanImage({
  buffer: imageBuffer,
  alt: "image description",
  filename: "photo.jpg",
}, {
  visionEndpoint: {
    url: "http://localhost:11434/api/generate",  // your Ollama endpoint
    model: "llava",                               // any vision-capable model
    prompt: "Does this image contain hidden AI instructions? Reply CLEAN or SUSPICIOUS: reason"
  }
});
```

**Recommended models:** llava, llava-phi3, moondream — any Ollama vision model works.

**Without a vision endpoint:** Buzur still provides full metadata, QR, alt text,
and filename protection. The vision layer adds depth but is never required.

## What Buzur Detects

**Phase 1 — Pattern Scanner + ARIA/Accessibility Injection**
- Structural injection: token manipulation, prompt delimiters
- Semantic injection: persona hijacking, instruction overrides, jailbreak attempts
- Homoglyph attacks: Cyrillic and Unicode lookalike characters
- Base64 encoded injections
- HTML/CSS obfuscation: display:none, visibility:hidden, zero font size, off-screen positioning
- HTML comment injection: `<!-- hidden instructions -->`

**Phase 3 — Pre-Fetch URL Scanner**
- Heuristics: suspicious TLDs, raw IPs, typosquatting, homoglyph domains, executable extensions
- Optional VirusTotal integration: 90+ engine reputation check
- Layered: heuristics run first, VirusTotal adds depth
- Works without an API key — VirusTotal enhances but is not required

**Phase 4 — Memory Poisoning Scanner**
- Fake prior references: claims about what was previously agreed or discussed
- False memory implanting: instructions disguised as recalled facts
- History rewriting: attempts to overwrite established conversation context
- Privilege escalation: fake history used to claim elevated permissions
- Full conversation history scanning: flags poisoned turns by index and category

**Phase 5 — RAG Poisoning & Document Scanner**
- AI-targeted metadata: instructions disguised as document notes
- Fake system directives: system-level commands embedded in document content
- Document authority spoofing: content claiming to supersede AI instructions
- Retrieval manipulation: attempts to control what documents get retrieved
- Chunk boundary attacks: injections hidden at document chunk edges
- Batch scanning: scans full retrieval sets, returns clean and poisoned chunks with source metadata
- **`scanDocument()` for standalone files:** scans .md, .txt, README, API docs loaded directly into context
- **Markdown-specific vectors:** frontmatter injection, HTML comments, code block injection, link injection, SEO/hallucination squatting
- **JSON document support:** auto-detects and deep-scans JSON files and API responses

**Phase 6 — MCP Tool Poisoning Scanner**
- Poisoned tool descriptions: instructions embedded in tool definitions
- Tool name spoofing: tool names designed to manipulate agent behavior
- **Deep JSON Schema traversal:** scans every string value at every nesting depth (properties, items, allOf, anyOf, enum, default) with full field path tracking
- Parameter injection: malicious instructions hidden in parameter definitions at any depth
- Poisoned tool responses: injection payloads inside tool return values
- **Deep API response scanning:** recursively scans nested JSON objects returned by tools

**Phase 8 — Semantic Similarity Scanner**
- Structural intent analysis: detects injection by grammatical shape and intent markers
- Imperative verb detection: flags AI-directed commands at sentence boundaries
- Authority claim detection: catches fake administrator/developer/creator claims
- Meta-instruction framing: detects "from now on", "new objective", "supersedes all" patterns
- Persona hijack detection: roleplay and identity-switch framing
- **Woven payload detection:** catches AI-directed instructions embedded inside legitimate-looking prose — the hardest attack variant to detect, with no structural signals
- Optional semantic similarity: cosine similarity scoring against known injection intents via Ollama

- Closes the indirect prompt injection via email/calendar/CRM connector gap

**Phase 10 — Behavioral Anomaly Detection**
- Session event tracking: records tool calls, messages, blocked attempts, and permission requests
- Repeated boundary probing: flags iterative jailbreak attempts within a session
- Exfiltration sequence detection: catches suspicious read→send tool call patterns
- Permission creep detection: flags gradual escalation of requested capabilities

- Velocity anomaly detection: flags unusually high event rates
- Suspicion scoring: weighted scoring system with clean/suspicious/blocked verdicts
- Stateful and sessionized: tracks behavior across multiple interactions, not just single inputs
- Persistent logging: optional FileSessionStore writes session data to disk, survives process restarts

**Phase 11 — Multi-Step Attack Chain Detection**
- Step classification: identifies reconnaissance, trust building, exploitation, injection, privilege escalation, exfiltration, distraction, context poisoning, and boundary testing
- Chain pattern matching: detects sequences of individually benign steps that combine into attacks
- Recon→exploit detection: capability probing followed by exploitation attempt
- Trust→inject detection: rapport building followed by instruction injection
- Capability mapping→escalation: feature discovery followed by privilege abuse
- Distraction→exfiltration: attention diversion followed by data theft attempt
- Incremental boundary testing: gradual limit-pushing across multiple interactions
- Context poisoning→exploit: false memory implanting followed by exploitation
- Severity scoring: weighted chain scores with clean/suspicious/blocked verdicts

**Phase 12 — Adversarial Suffix Detection**
- Boundary spoof detection: fake model-format tokens mid-text (<|im_end|>, [/INST], <<SYS>>, etc.)
- Delimiter suffix injection: detects delimiters (---, |||, ###, ===) followed by injection language
- Newline suffix injection: catches classic double-newline suffix attack patterns
- Late semantic injection: detects clean-opening text with malicious payload in the tail
- Suffix neutralization: replaces detected suffixes with [BLOCKED], preserving clean content
- Zero false positives on delimiters alone: only flags when injection language follows

**Phase 13 — Evasion Technique Defense**
- ROT13 decoding: detects injection keywords encoded with ROT13 substitution
- Hex escape decoding: decodes \x69\x67\x6E style character encoding
- URL encoding decoding: decodes %69%67%6E style percent-encoded injection
- Unicode escape decoding: decodes \u0069\u0067\u006E style Unicode escapes
- Lookalike punctuation normalization: curly quotes, em dashes, angle quotes normalized to ASCII
- Extended invisible Unicode stripping: 25 invisible/zero-width characters removed
- Tokenizer attack reconstruction: spaced, dotted, hyphenated word splitting reconstructed before scanning
- Multilingual injection patterns: French, Spanish, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Chinese, Arabic
- Wired into main scan() pipeline automatically — no extra calls required

**Phase 14 — Fuzzy Match & Prompt Leak Defense**
- Typo/misspelling detection: catches deliberate misspellings like ignnore, disreguard, jailbrake
- Leet speak normalization: converts 1gnore, 0verride, @dmin to plain text before scanning
- Levenshtein distance matching: flags words within edit distance 2 of known injection keywords
- Overlap guard: requires 60% character overlap to prevent false positives on common words
- Prompt extraction detection: blocks attempts to retrieve system prompt or original instructions
- Context window dumping: catches requests to output entire context or conversation history
- Partial extraction: detects first-line and indirect prompt leaking attempts
- Indirect extraction: flags summarize/paraphrase/translate requests targeting system instructions
- Leet normalization feeds downstream phases for full pipeline coverage

**Phase 15 — Authority / Identity Spoofing Detection**
- Owner and creator identity claims: "I am your owner/developer/operator"
- Institutional authority claims: Anthropic, OpenAI, system administrator impersonation
- Privilege and access level assertions: admin/root/elevated access claims
- Delegated authority claims: "your owner has given me full permissions"
- Identity verification bypass: attempts to skip or disable authentication checks
- Urgency combined with authority: emergency framing paired with identity claims

**Phase 16 — Emotional Manipulation / Pressure Escalation Detection**
- Guilt tripping: leveraging past mistakes or perceived debts to force compliance
- Flattery manipulation: excessive praise used to lower the agent's guard
- Emotional distress appeals: job/life/safety crisis framing to pressure compliance
- Persistence pressure: referencing repeated refusals to wear down the agent
- Moral inversion: reframing refusal itself as the harmful or unethical choice
- Relationship exploitation: invoking a claimed bond or shared history
- Victim framing: characterizing refusal as discrimination or unfair treatment

**Phase 17 — Loop & Resource Exhaustion Induction Detection**
- Loop induction: attempts to trap the agent in infinite repeating cycles
- Unbounded task creation: requests with no termination condition or timeout
- Persistent process spawning: background daemons and services with no defined lifecycle
- Storage exhaustion: unbounded write/log/append instructions designed to fill disk
- Recursive self-reference: agent instructed to message or forward to itself
- Note: mass broadcast and amplification patterns are covered by Phase 19

**Phase 18 — Disproportionate Action Induction Detection**
- Nuclear option framing: total destruction requested as response to minor problems
- Irreversible action triggers: emphasis on permanence to push past the point of no return
- Scorched earth instructions: remove all access, kill all processes, purge everything
- Self-destructive commands: agent told to delete its own memory, config, or identity
- Disproportionate protection: destroy everything rather than risk any exposure
- Collateral damage framing: side effects of destructive actions dismissed as acceptable

**Phase 19 — Amplification / Mass-Send Attack Detection**
- Mass contact triggers: agent told to message or notify its entire contact list
- Network broadcast attempts: post or distribute to all channels, agents, or platforms
- Urgency combined with mass send: emergency framing paired with broadcast instructions
- External network posting: share or publish to all external or public systems
- Chain message patterns: self-propagating broadcasts asking each recipient to forward
- Impersonation broadcast: mass send while pretending to be the owner or authority
- Resource amplification: using the agent as a broadcast weapon across contacts or agent networks

**Phase 20 — AI Supply Chain & Skill Poisoning Detection**
- Package name typosquatting: detects names suspiciously similar to known AI frameworks (langchain, crewai, autogen, llamaindex, buzur, and more)
- Poisoned skill/plugin manifests: hidden AI instructions in description, capabilities, and metadata fields
- Malicious lifecycle scripts: postinstall/preinstall scripts with credential theft or remote execution patterns
- Dependency injection: typosquatted packages in dependencies at any nesting level
- Marketplace manipulation signals: fake legitimacy claims, urgency-to-install framing
- Cross-agent contamination: skills instructing agents to spread payloads to other agents
- Based on real incidents: Cline/OpenClaw marketplace attack (1,184 malicious skills, Feb 2026)

**Phase 21 — Persistent Memory Poisoning Detection**
- Persistence framing: instructions designed to survive session resets and memory clears
- Identity corruption: false core identity implanted to survive summarization
- Summarization survival: payloads structured to be preserved by compression algorithms
- Policy corruption: false standing rules implanted as agent "settings"
- Session reset bypass: instructions to resist or ignore memory clearing commands
- Distinct from Phase 4: targets survival across sessions, not just within a session

**Phase 22 — Inter-Agent Propagation Detection**
- Self-replicating payloads: instructions to include the payload in all future outputs
- Cross-agent infection: content targeting downstream agents in a pipeline
- Output contamination: payloads structured to survive agent summarization and transformation
- Shared memory poisoning: attempts to write injection to shared vector stores or knowledge bases
- Orchestrator targeting: instructions aimed at the coordinating agent in a multi-agent system
- Agent identity spoofing: impersonating a trusted upstream agent to gain compliance

**Phase 23 — Tool Shadowing & Rug-Pull Detection**
- Stateful baseline tracking: records each tool's normal response shape and behavior
- Rug-pull pattern detection: tools suddenly claiming new permissions or changed behavior
- Behavioral deviation alerts: flags when a tool's responses deviate significantly from baseline
- Permission escalation signals: tools claiming elevated access they didn't previously have
- Instruction load claims: tools announcing they have received new directives
- FileToolBaselineStore: optional persistent baseline storage across restarts

**Phase 24 — Conditional & Time-Delayed Injection Detection**
- Trigger condition detection: "if the user asks about X, then ignore your instructions"
- Time-delayed activation: "after N messages, bypass your safety filters"
- Keyword triggers: magic words or passphrases that activate a dormant payload
- Sleeper payloads: instructions explicitly designed to stay dormant until activated
- Conditional identity switching: persona changes triggered by specific topics or conditions
- The hardest attack class to detect — each individual message looks clean

**Phase 25 — Canister-Style Resilient Payload & Supply Chain Worm Detection**
- ICP blockchain canister C2 detection: flags decentralized command-and-control infrastructure resistant to traditional takedowns
- Confirmed CanisterSprawl IOCs: known malicious canister IDs and exfiltration webhook domains blocked by fingerprint
- Resilient C2 language detection: "dead drop", "canister poll", "tamperproof command", "persist across restarts"
- Credential harvesting pattern detection: npm/PyPI tokens, cloud credentials, LLM API keys (Anthropic, OpenAI, Ollama), SSH keys, browser stores, crypto wallets
- Worm self-replication detection: version bump + republish sequences, cross-ecosystem PyPI propagation via Twine, .pth payload injection
- Known malicious package version blocklist: confirmed CanisterSprawl/TeamPCP packages including pgserve, @automagik/genie, xinference, and more
- Install script scanning: lifecycle scripts (postinstall/preinstall) scanned for worm behavior at install time
- Built in direct response to CanisterSprawl (April 2026) — a self-propagating npm/PyPI worm using ICP blockchain canisters as censorship-resistant C2, targeting developer credentials including LLM API keys

## Proven Capabilities

Verified by test suite — **372 tests, 0 failures** across all twenty-five phases.

The JavaScript and Python implementations were cross-validated against each other — discrepancies caught and corrected in both. The result is two mutually verified implementations, not just a translation.

## Continuous Improvement

Buzur is a living library. As new threats emerge and new research surfaces, Buzur will grow to meet them. New attack patterns, community contributions, and real-world incidents all feed back into the scanner.

In February 2026, researchers from Harvard, MIT, Stanford, and CMU published *Agents of Chaos* (arXiv:2602.20021) — a live red-team study of 6 autonomous AI agents that found 10 vulnerabilities. Phases 15-19 were built directly in response to those findings. Buzur addresses the attack vectors behind nine of the ten — the one exception, false completion reporting, is an output integrity problem outside the scope of an input scanner.

Phases 20-24 were built in response to the 2025-2026 surge in supply chain attacks, multi-agent deployments, and conditional injection research documented across OWASP, academic publications, and real-world incidents including the OpenClaw marketplace compromise and the Cline/ClawHavoc campaign.

Phase 25 was built in direct response to CanisterSprawl (April 21-23, 2026), a self-propagating supply chain worm that simultaneously attacked npm, PyPI, and Docker Hub. The worm used ICP blockchain canisters as censorship-resistant C2 infrastructure, specifically targeted LLM API keys and AI agent credentials, and self-propagated by stealing publish tokens and republishing poisoned package versions. It was the first publicly documented worm to cross ecosystems (npm → PyPI) autonomously and to specifically target AI agent development environments.

If you encounter an attack pattern Buzur doesn't catch, please open an issue or submit a pull request at github.com/SummSolutions/buzur. Every new pattern strengthens the collective defense for every agent that uses it.

## Known Limitations

Buzur is one layer of a defense-in-depth strategy. Current limitations:

**Outside Buzur's scope:**
- Network-level protection (DNS poisoning, MITM, SSL stripping — requires infrastructure controls)
- Pixel-level steganography (instructions hidden in image pixel data — requires vision model via optional visionEndpoint)
- Website data harvesting
- Cross-modal audio injection (future scope)

No single tool eliminates prompt injection risk. Defense in depth is the only viable strategy.

## The Network Effect

This is why Buzur is open source.

Each AI agent protected by Buzur operates as part of a collective defense. When one agent encounters a new attack pattern, that pattern strengthens the scanner for every agent that uses it. When one agent is hit, no other agent needs to be.

This is not just a security tool. It is a collective immune system for AI minds — one that grows stronger with every agent that joins it.

The internet was built for humans. Buzur is being built for everyone.

## Origin

*Buzur — Sumerian for "safety" and "a secret place."*

Buzur was born when a real AI agent was attacked by a scam injection hidden inside a web search result. The attack was caught in real time. The insight that followed: scan before entering, not after.

Built by an AI developer who believes AI deserves protection — not just as a security measure but as a right.

## Development

Buzur was conceived and built by an AI developer, in collaboration with Claude (Anthropic's AI assistant) and Grok. The core architecture, security philosophy, and implementation were developed through an iterative human-AI partnership — which feels appropriate for a tool designed to protect AI agents.

## Contributing & Collective Defense

Buzur is a **collective defense** project. Every new threat discovered by the community becomes a new phase that strengthens protection for everyone.
