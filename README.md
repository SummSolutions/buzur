# buzur
**AI prompt injection defense scanner.**

*Buzur — Sumerian for "safety" and "a secret place."*

Buzur protects AI agents from prompt injection attacks — the hidden threat that turns an agent's greatest strength (connecting to the world) into its greatest vulnerability.

## The Problem

AI agents that search the web are exposed to malicious content designed to hijack their behavior. A single poisoned search result can override an agent's instructions, change its persona, or exfiltrate data. This is called **indirect prompt injection** — ranked #1 on the OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications.

## Buzur's Approach

Scan before you enter. Not patch after the fact.

## Installation

npm install buzur

## Usage

import { scan, getTrustTier, isTier1Domain, addTrustedDomain } from "buzur";

// Phase 1: Scan web content before passing to your LLM
const result = scan(webSearchResult);
if (result.blocked > 0) {
  console.log("Buzur blocked " + result.blocked + " injection attempt(s).");
}
// Pass result.clean to your LLM instead of raw content

// Phase 2: Check query trust tier
const tier = getTrustTier(userQuery);
// Returns "technical" or "general"

// Phase 2: Verify a domain is trusted
const trusted = isTier1Domain("https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/...");

// Add your own trusted domains
addTrustedDomain("yourtrustedsource.com");

## What Buzur Detects

Phase 1 — Pattern Scanner
- Structural injection: token manipulation, prompt delimiters
- Semantic injection: persona hijacking, instruction overrides, jailbreak attempts

Phase 2 — Tiered Trust System
- Classifies queries as technical or general
- Maintains a curated list of Tier 1 trusted domains
- Extensible with addTrustedDomain()

Phase 3 — Pre-Fetch URL Scanner (coming soon)
- Scans URLs before fetching
- Domain reputation, redirect chains, suspicious pattern detection

## Proven Capabilities

Verified by test suite — 10 tests, 0 failures:

- Blocks direct instruction overrides
- Blocks persona hijacking
- Passes clean content untouched
- Normalizes Cyrillic homoglyph attacks
- Blocks Cyrillic homoglyph attacks
- Blocks Base64 encoded injections
- Classifies technical queries correctly
- Classifies general queries correctly
- Recognizes trusted domains
- Rejects untrusted domains

## Known Limitations

Buzur is one layer of a defense-in-depth strategy. It excels at content scanning but does not address every threat AI agents face. Current limitations:

**Not yet implemented (planned for Buzur):**
- Multi-turn memory poisoning — gradual injection built across multiple messages
- RAG poisoning — malicious content injected into knowledge base documents before ingestion
- MCP tool poisoning — malicious instructions embedded in tool descriptions or responses
- Pre-fetch URL scanning — Phase 3, coming soon

**Outside Buzur's scope (require separate tools):**
- Network-level protection — blocking hostile sites, preventing agent fingerprinting
- Image-based injection — malicious instructions hidden inside images processed by vision models
- Website data harvesting — hostile sites profiling your agent via request patterns

**Recommended approach:**
Buzur works best as part of a layered defense. Pair it with network-level controls and careful RAG ingestion pipelines for comprehensive protection.

No single tool eliminates prompt injection risk. Defense in depth is the only viable strategy.

## Origin

Buzur was born when a real AI agent was attacked by a Bitcoin scam injection hidden inside a web search result. The attack was caught in real time. The insight that followed: scan before entering, not after.

## Development

Buzur was conceived and built by an AI developer, who believe AI deserves protection, in collaboration with Claude (Anthropic's AI assistant). The core architecture, security philosophy, and implementation were developed through an
iterative human-AI partnership - which feels appropriate for a tool designed to protect AI agents.
